# ELTP Project
ELTP Project

For this project to work, you will have to install 2 librairies : 
pip install xgboost
pip install catboost

We advise you to run this on a computer with a high end GPU or collab with GPU instance,
as our best model is a catboost model with 25 000 estimators, which takes 3 hours to train on a GPU.
if no GPU is found, the catboost model will simply not run
